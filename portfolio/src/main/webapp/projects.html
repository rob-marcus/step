        <p>I've worked on two major projects. In high school I researched and 
        designed medical exoskeletons (you can read more about it 
        <a href=http://awstrol.com target="_blank">here</a>). My freshman year I studied generating
        3D models of art from regular images using computer vision. I called my 
        program Paint By Number. I'm still deeply interested in both, and look 
        forward to working on them more
        in the future.  Painting source: Van Gogh.</p>
      <div id="tiles2"></div>
        <p>The basic idea with Paint By Number was to segment each image by 
        distinct brushstrokes, and then apply a filter to each brushstroke
        mapping relative pixel energy to grayscale, in turn giving a pseudo-3D
        representation. Below are some examples of images and their corresponding 
        depth map. This is still a work in progress! Painting source: Van Gogh.
