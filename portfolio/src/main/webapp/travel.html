        <p>I love to travel, and I really love to travel to desolate places.
        My dream vacation is to go visit the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibesti_Mountains" 
        target="_blank"> Tibesti Mountain range</a> in Northern Chad. I've been 
        fascinated by Tibesti ever since I read about it in Dino Buzatti's  
        <i>The Walls of Anagoor</i>. It's a mountain range that almost nobody has
        visited, even scientists and anthropologists who would love to do 
        research there. That's why most of the photos you'll see of it are from 
        space, and not the ground. How many places the size of Germany can you 
        say that about?</p>
      <div id="tiles2"></div>
        <p>Besides Chad, I've been fortunate enough to visit some other places
        I've always wanted to visit. On my gap year I lived in Alaska for 
        seven months, working on commercial salmon boats to get me by. I also 
        lived in Colombia for several months, working as an English teacher by
        day and driving around the city on a cheap motorcycle in my birks by 
        night. I also travelled up the Mekong river system over three months 
        as a student on a cultural immersion trip, which was more exotic but 
        a lot less dangerous.</p>
