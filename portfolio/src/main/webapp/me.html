      <p>Hi. I'm Robbie (also Rob). I'm a rising Junior at Carnegie Mellon.
      When I'm not studying I spend most of my time playing squash or blowing
      glass. Sadly I don't have (m)any photos of me doing those things ðŸ˜­. 
      Before coming to CMU, I spent most of my time wearing funny hats and 
      hiking or trail running. Sadly pittsburgh isn't a hiking town, and 
      I've traded in my funny hats for serious hats. I also went to highschool,
      but we don't talk about that.</p>
      <div id="tiles2"></div>
        <p>I'm home right now in Connecticut. Normally when I'm home it's a holiday, 
        and my family celebrate's holidays by fostering seeing eye puppies for a 
        week. Sadly WFH/social isolation is not a holiday.</p>
      <div id="tiles3"></div>
        <p>Everybody has a definitive moment in their life. I've had a few. 
        The most important for me was taking a gap year. I spent most of the 
        time working. Still, I had some incredible moments, went almost everywhere 
        you can go. One notable accomplishment that I'll (hopefully) never repeat: 
        I wore the same outfit for a month and change without showering/washing! 
        On the left is me smiling and thinking I have a great, clean, pleasant 
        smelling future. On the right is me smiling because it was almost time to 
        leave the fishing boats and go back to civilization!</p> 
      <div id="tiles4"></div>
        <p>Taking a gap year didn't just change my outlooks, perspective, and 
          tolerance level for unpleasant things. It also changed how I dress 
          (jury is still out on whether this is a good or bad thing...). 
        </p>
