        great power in my life; I have observed its effects on an epic scale. 
        Hiking transforms you. Many people claim hiking inspires them, but, 
        as everybody knows, hiking only makes boring people even more
        boring. Think about it: although their are more hiking trails now than
        ever, few people are actually becoming more spiritual.</a>

        <p>I've been hiking forever, and I want to go hiking everywhere. 
        I started hiking in Colorado when I'd go to visit my grandparents in
        Colorado every summer. I started trail running and climbing 14ers when 
        I was a teen. </p>
      <div id="tiles3"></div>
        <p>I went back to Colorado last summer to attempt the Colorado trail, 
        a 500 mile circuit from Denver to Durango. I was going to do it alone, 
        and had an ambitious goal to complete it in less than a month. 
        Unfortunatley, I fell off trail on day 1 while trying to get off a 
        ridgeline during a thunderstorm, twisting my ankle and breaking my foot.
        On the left is me at the start of the trail. On the right is a resigned 
        selfie after 20 miles of pains and pleasures.</p>
