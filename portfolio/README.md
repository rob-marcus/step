# An Outline For This Portfolio

Here's what I'm told this should at least have: 

1. Couple fun paragraphs about me
2. A list of projects I've worked on
3. A link to my linkedin and github profiles 
4. Images/some sort of gallery 
5. A couple paragraphs about what I like photographing
6. Some blog posts explaining what you enjoy photographing

OFC, it should also be my own so the above is a pretty loose list. A website 
that does the above is basically a static webpage, so I could use JS to give
some cool textual effects (I think? Don't really know JS so my plan is to 
pick up the basics tomorrow.) Alternatively, could make some kind of basic 
JS game and tie in with my photos (something very basic, like ping pong... 
which i love.)

So for a basic v1 website I think I should write a basic static version of 
1-6, and time/knowledge/js ability permitting, see how i can dynamic-ify 
everything else.  


Keeping around for my convenience in case i forget: 

to run a local server, execute this
command:

```bash
mvn package appengine:run
```
